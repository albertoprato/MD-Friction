# Classical Molecular Dynamics & Friction Tensor Calculation

This Fortran project simulates the classical molecular dynamics (MD) of a solute consisting of four spheres immersed in a viscous solvent. The simulation uses Lennard-Jones potentials and integrates the equations of motion using the Velocity Verlet algorithm.

The primary goal of this software is to compute the **friction tensor** of the solute as a function of time by analyzing the time-autocorrelation of the forces experienced by the solute particles.

## Features

* **Force Field**: Lennard-Jones potential with cutoff and Minimum Image Convention.
    * Solvent-Solvent interactions.
    * Solute-Solvent interactions.
* **Integration**: Velocity Verlet algorithm for stable time integration.
* **Minimization**: Conjugate Gradient (Polak-Ribiere) method to relax the initial solvent structure.
* **Initialization**: Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution with center-of-mass drift removal.
* **Analysis**: Computation of the friction tensor via the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem, implemented using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTW3).

## Prerequisites

To compile and run this simulation, you need:

1.  **GFortran**: The GNU Fortran compiler.
2.  **FFTW3**: The "Fastest Fourier Transform in the West" library.
3.  **Make**: GNU Make build tool.

## Compilation

A `Makefile` is provided in the `LJ/` directory.

1.  Navigate to the source directory:
    ```bash
    cd LJ
    ```
2.  Compile the code:
    ```bash
    make
    ```
    *Note: If your FFTW3 library is installed in a non-standard location, you may need to edit the `LDFLAGS` or `FFLAGS` in the `Makefile`.*

3.  This will generate an executable named `simulation`.

## Usage

The program requires two input files to be present in the same directory as the executable:

1.  `input.txt`: Simulation parameters.
2.  `system.xyz`: Initial atomic coordinates (e.g., generated by Packmol).

To run the simulation:

```bash
./simulation
